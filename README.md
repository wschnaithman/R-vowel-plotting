# R-vowel-plotting
Use R to plot 1st &amp; 2nd formants for up to 10 vowels from a speaker
Save .csv file to local directory
Open R script (in R)
Run R script - The sample data should demonstrate the vowel plots of 10 vowels
Now, you can enter your own data into the .csv file
You may need to adjust the local file name / directory of the .csv file in lines 15 and 18 of the R script
Note: In the .csv file, do not alter any of the head names (in row 1).
To change the symbol graphed for the data set, modify the symbols in the respective quality_X line(s) (where x = a vowel symbol)
The data which is graphed comes from the F1_average_X & F2_average_X values. 
For the graph generated from this script, the duration_X data has no effect.
